# This is the startup script for the wallpaper service (swww-daemon)
# This will basically start up your wallpaper for your system.
#
# I, the developer am NOT sure if this works on any other DE/WM other than Hyprland
# So if you are using something other than Hyprland, please disable this unless you are debugging!
#
# The default is 0 (off).
swww Wallpaper = 1

# This is where you put the file name of the image you wish to use for the wallpaper daemon.
# You should store this image in celestia/Wallpapers/ for it to be detected.
Wallpaper = 1293921(1).png


# This is the startup script for AGS (The top bar)
# This is mostly made for end-4's dot-files (https://github.com/end-4/dots-hyprland)
# If you do NOT use this, you should turn this off.
#
# However, if you have your own config bar for AGS, you may turn this on.
# sDo you use a different Bar? Go ahead and edit the Scripts/Bar.sh and change the 'ags &' line to what you use.
# The default is 0 (off).
Bar = 1

# This is the startup script for the networking. This will detect the network(s) that you specified at the setup script.
# The only requirement is that you have already connected to this internet once as this will NOT put in any passphrases.
# Want to add another network? Build another block in /Scripts/Network.sh
# Use a different network manager other than nmcli or don't use Wi-Fi? You can either:
# Disable it
#     Or
# Edit the block in /Script/Network.sh
#
# The default is 1 (on).
Network = 1

# This is the startup script for USB Mounting.
# I made this basically because it was a hassle to sudo mount /dev/sdb1 to my directory.
# You technically do NOT have to keep this on, but if you also deal with this, feel free to use it.
# The default is 0 (off).
USB = 0

# If the USB Script is on, please lsblk and grab the size of what you are mounting.

# If the USB Script is on, please state the directory you want to mount the USB to.

# This is just to run package updates.
# To make sure your linux is up to date, it is recommended to NOT turn this off.
# This setting is mainly for standalone systems, meaning you and YOU ONLY access this system.
#
# Though, if this is a community-shared system, it is recommended to TURN THIS OFF,
# And delete the /Scripts/.packages.exp file, as this contains your file in plaintext.
# I am not liable for what happens as I have given you my discretion and tried my best to hide it.
#
# The default is 1 (on), to turn off, set to 0.
Packages = 1

# If the Packages Script is on, please provide your package manager.
# If you use Arch Linux, pacman INCLUDES yay as part of its upgrades.
